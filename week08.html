    <h1>Notes: Transformations and Transitions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Simply put translations allow elements to move in any of the four basic directions; up, down, left, right</li>
        <li>We are able to scale these transforms using BIFs such as scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) to affect the x or y axis respectively</li>
        <li>Rotation is another tool that we have and does exactly what you think it would do! We can usue rotate() to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Canvas, SVG and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cavas API is a very powerful tool. It allows us to draw just about anything with the use of Javascript</li>
        <li>If the browser you are using supports Canvas, we can use a cavas tag to be able to use it.</li>
    </ul>
