    <h1>Notes:</h1>
    <p>There was a great resource this week about Master Mobile UX. I thought it was a good resource because it reminded me of designing for mobile first.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The video mentions that designing for mobile first not only is better visually, but it helps you to recognize what is important to put on the screen, which creates better programs.</p>
