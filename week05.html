    <h1>Notes: Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2>Errors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are generally 3 Types of errors when it comes to debugging: System, Programmer or User Error</li>
        <li>There is little that we as programmers can do do fix system errors, so it is important to minimize the amount of errors that we the programmers make or the users make. </li>
        <li>As we improve and do better as programmers it will lead to less errors both by us and the user. Good desgin leads to less errors overall.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Warnings are good and bad.</li>
        <li>Warnings are good because if the problem isn't large enough to crash the program and allows it to continue to run.</li>
        <li>Warnings are bad beause they are allow the program to run with a defect in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Debugging and Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are many tools to help us debug and to test our programs.</li>
        <li>Some tools include linting tools, such as JS Lint</li>
        <li>From my understanding JS Lint scans the code to see if it will agree with the rules of the code.</li>
    </ul>
