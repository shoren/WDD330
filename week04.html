    <h1>Notes:</h1>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reset buttons for forms can often been seen as poor use, because they can be easily clicked and wipe out all of the info collected</li>
        <li>Autofocus is a powerful tool. When the page loads it will focus on the element with this attribute.</li>
        <li>Input type is another useful tool to be able to modify the form depending on input or style, such as "password" or "radio"</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OO Prgramming in Javascript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When using a contructor, parentheses are not needed. Only when we are passing an argument to the object.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism is a concept where different objects can have the same method, but they use it differently.</li>
        <li>Objects can be created from other objects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Modern Javascript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Projects can get very large, so it is important to stay organized and utilize the tools that are avaliable.</li>
        <li>One tool that is avaliable is Libraries. They have advantages as well as disadvantages</li>
    </ul>
